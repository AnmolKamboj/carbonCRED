The {% syntax is part of Jinja2, a templating engine used with Flask. It’s used here (e.g., {% extends "layouts/base.html" %}) to define dynamic logic, like inheriting a base template, setting blocks (e.g., title, content), or looping through data (e.g., {% for %}). Unlike plain HTML, which is static, this syntax allows you to inject Python-like logic and variables (e.g., {{ message }}) into your templates, making them reusable and dynamic. It’s better than normal HTML because it reduces redundancy (via template inheritance) and enables server-side rendering of data, which plain HTML can’t do without JavaScript or additional tools.
